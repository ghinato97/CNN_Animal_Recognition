# Project Details:
## Dataset: 
    Using the CIFAR dataset, containing thousands of images labeled in various categories, including vehicles and animals.
## Algorithm: 
    Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image analysis and classification.
## Output: 
    The system will correctly classify each image as a vehicle or animal.
## Evaluation of the Model:
    Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified images to the total.
    Accuracy: Quality of positive predictions, indicating the proportion of correctly identified images.
## Analysis of Results:
    Identification of any error patterns.
    Evaluation of systematically confused image categories.
    Examination of erroneous images and reflection on possible improvements to the model.
